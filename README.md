# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## Problem Statement
This project is to determine if a driver is likely to accept coupons from restaurants. The data for the project is based on a survey that describes different driving scenarios including destination, weather, passenger, and whether the people will accept the coupon if they are the driver. You can find a link to my Jupyter notebook detailing my work here.
